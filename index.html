          Imagine you could fight alongside your favorite Star Wars character in a legendary battle: Han Solo, Darth Vader, Leia Organa, Padme Amidala, or even the notorious bounty hunter, Boba Fette. Well, here is your chance.<br> 
        </p>
        Star Wars Legion is a tabletop miniatures wargame by 
        <a href="https://www.atomicmassgames.com/" target="_blank"> 
          Atomic Mass Games</a> 
          
          that allows players to recreate battles from the Star Wars universe using small, highly detailed figurines. It's similar to games like Warhammer 40,000 or Age of Sigmar.

In the game, you build and paint your armies, which can include iconic Star Wars characters, troopers, and vehicles. Each player takes turns moving their units and engaging in tactical battles on a game board.

The objective is to complete mission objectives, defeat your opponent's forces, or achieve specific goals depending on the scenario you're playing. It's a fun way to immerse yourself in the Star Wars galaxy and engage in strategic warfare on your tabletop.
